## [00:00] COLD OPEN — The Most Consequential Development This Week

**Duration:** 1.0 minutes

### Speaker Notes

Open on the Iran nuclear headline. This is the single biggest probability shift in our model this week — Oil Below $55 jumped 10.5 percentage points. That one headline cascades into Saudi fiscal math, Russian war economy sustainability, Canadian energy revenue, and the entire OPEC+ framework. If Iran returns to full production, the global energy chess board resets. Let's break it down.

### Key Data Points

- Oil Below $55 scenario: +10.5% probability this week
- Iran signaling nuclear compromise for first time in 18 months
- Combined effect of Iran + Venezuela blockade + Rubio CEE tour

## [02:00] CRACK WATCH — Global Economic Regime Assessment

**Duration:** 3.5 minutes

### Speaker Notes

Our crack detection engine monitors 7 multi-indicator patterns across all 20 economies. This week's assessment: Turkey remains the most stressed economy with 5 active crack patterns at 87% confidence — consumer credit, corporate spreads, labor market, EM vulnerability, and infrastructure constraints all firing. Russia is showing stress at 55% as the war economy burns through reserves. China at 45% — property sector is the big one. Argentina at 72% — no surprises there. The interesting one is Saudi Arabia creeping up to 30% — the Iran deal headline is what's driving that, because if oil stays below Saudi's fiscal breakeven of $78, Vision 2030 starts getting cut.

Key indicator moves: US credit card delinquencies at 3.8%, above our 3.5% threshold but no pattern activation because the other consumer indicators are holding. Watch this one — auto loan delinquencies at 4.2% are also above threshold. If savings rate drops below 3%, the Consumer Credit Stress pattern activates for the US.

### Key Data Points

- Turkey: 87% confidence, 5 active patterns, 19/34 indicators breached
- Russia: 55% confidence, 3 active patterns (energy, labor, EM vulnerability)
- China: 45% confidence, 3 active patterns (property-driven)
- US: 4 indicators breached but 0 patterns activated (near-miss on consumer credit)
- Saudi Arabia: rising to 30% on oil price pressure

## [05:30] THE WIRE — This Week's Headlines Decoded

**Duration:** 5.0 minutes

### Speaker Notes

Every headline is a signal. Our system maps each one to specific actors, affected stats, scenario probability shifts, and generational plan impacts. Let me walk you through the 7 most consequential signals from this week.

Number 1: Carney appoints a Chief Trade Negotiator. This isn't just a personnel announcement. This is Canada signaling to the US that USMCA is a top-of-government priority. It shifts our USMCA Renegotiation scenario from 50% to 55%, and the Withdrawal Threat drops from 15% to 12%. For Carney, this is objective CAN_OBJ_1 — USMCA survival is existential.

Number 2: Rubio in Slovakia and Hungary. This is Energy Dominance in action — USA_OBJ_1. The US is actively trying to replace Russian gas in Central Eastern Europe with American LNG. Every pipeline that switches from Gazprom to Cheniere is a direct revenue hit to Russia's war economy. This threatens RUS_OBJ_1 and advances DEU_OBJ_1.

Number 3: Iran nuclear compromise signal. This is the big one. If Iran returns to full production, that's 1.5 million barrels per day back on the market. Oil Below $55 jumped 5 percentage points on this alone. Saudi Arabia's fiscal breakeven is $78 — that's the gap between Vision 2030 continuing and Vision 2030 getting cut.

Number 4: Venezuela tanker boarding. The US military is now physically enforcing energy policy. This is a precedent — the same interdiction framework applies to Russian shadow fleet tankers. Russia noticed.

I'll cover the remaining signals in the script notes, but the pattern is clear: energy is the dominant axis this week. Five of seven headlines touch energy markets.

### Key Data Points

- USMCA Renegotiation: 50% → 55%
- Oil Below $55: 40% → 50.5% (biggest single-week shift)
- European Energy Shock: 8% → 6% (Rubio's CEE play helping)
- USMCA Withdrawal: 15% → 12%
- 5 of 7 headlines touch energy markets directly

## [10:30] DEEP DIVE — United States — Generational Strategic Plan

**Duration:** 6.0 minutes

### Speaker Notes

Every major power is executing a multi-decade plan. This week we focus on the United States — 'American Primacy Renewal.' Five objectives on the board.

Objective 1: Energy Dominance. Status: ON TRACK. This week validates it — Rubio selling LNG in Europe, Venezuela blockade controlling supply, Iran deal potentially adding supply that advantages US as price-maker not price-taker. The US is playing this brilliantly.

Objective 2: Technology Supremacy. ON TRACK. CHIPS Act fabs coming online 2026-2027. But there's a hidden dependency: AI needs energy. Objective 2 depends on Objective 1. This is why the grid reserve margin stat matters — if the US can't power the data centers, the AI lead evaporates.

Objective 3: Dollar Hegemony Defense. BEHIND. This is the weak flank. The Kallas-Rubio clash this week is symptomatic — every time the US alienates allies, it weakens the coalition that upholds dollar primacy. Meanwhile, China's RMB internationalization is quiet but persistent. The debt trajectory is the structural threat — $1.9T annual deficit.

Objective 4: Supply Chain Reshoring. BEHIND. USMCA is the vehicle here. Carney's trade negotiator appointment is actually good news for this objective — a stable USMCA is the foundation for nearshoring.

Objective 5: Fiscal Sustainability. BEHIND. This is the meta-risk. If the debt spiral becomes self-reinforcing, it undermines all other objectives simultaneously. OBBBA adds $3.7T — the bet is that growth outruns debt. That's a bet, not a plan.

The biggest risk: forced austerity from debt crisis cuts defense, AI investment, and energy infrastructure simultaneously. Everything is connected.

### Key Data Points

- Energy Dominance: ON TRACK — US now world's largest oil producer
- Tech Supremacy: ON TRACK — CHIPS Act fabs 2026-2027 timeline
- Dollar Hegemony: BEHIND — $1.9T annual deficit trajectory
- Supply Chain: BEHIND — USMCA renewal critical
- Fiscal: BEHIND — OBBBA adds $3.7T, betting on growth

## [16:30] THE BOARD — Resource Control & Competition Matrix

**Duration:** 3.0 minutes

### Speaker Notes

Quick hits on the resource game. Semiconductors: unchanged, US/NLD/JPN/KOR alliance holding. Taiwan remains the single point of failure. Rare earths: Canada advancing on processing — watch Saskatchewan. Copper: China's Africa hospital strategy is fundamentally a copper strategy. Every BRI infrastructure project in Zambia, Congo, Peru is about locking up the copper supply chain. Oil: the big mover this week. Three simultaneous developments — Iran compromise, Venezuela enforcement, Rubio CEE tour — all shift the supply picture. LNG: Rubio's Slovakia/Hungary visit is about creating new demand for US LNG exports. This is Energy Dominance in real time.

Competition update: USA vs China intensifying on tech. USA vs Russia escalating on energy and shadow fleet interdiction. Canada vs Australia heating up on critical minerals. India quietly advancing on manufacturing — Apple/Samsung shift accelerating.

### Key Data Points

- Oil: 3 supply-side developments this week
- China controls 87% of rare earth processing
- Canada positioning as democratic-aligned mineral alternative
- US LNG exports to Europe growing 15% YoY

## [19:30] WHAT'S NEXT — Predictions & Monitoring Priorities

**Duration:** 3.0 minutes

### Speaker Notes

Five things to watch next week:

1. Iran back-channel status. If the BBC interview translates into actual diplomatic contact, the Oil Below $55 scenario accelerates. Watch for State Department leaks.

2. US credit card delinquency data. We're at 3.8% against a 3.5% threshold. If next month's reading exceeds 4%, and the savings rate data comes in below 3%, the Consumer Credit Stress pattern activates for the US. That would be the first crack pattern activation for the world's largest economy since 2019.

3. Canada trade negotiator identity. Who Carney picks tells us the negotiating posture — an industry insider signals pragmatic deal-making, a political appointee signals hardball.

4. Saudi Aramco earnings. If revenue is down more than 12% YoY, MBS has to make hard choices about Vision 2030 spending.

5. European Parliament response to Kallas-Rubio exchange. If the rhetoric hardens into trade policy proposals, the transatlantic crack widens.

### Key Data Points

- US CC delinquency: 3.8% (threshold 3.5%, pattern trigger at 4%)
- Saudi Aramco earnings: expected -12% YoY revenue
- Iran: first diplomatic signal in 18 months

### Visual Cues

- 🎬 5-item watchlist with probability/impact scores
- 🎬 Calendar overlay showing data release dates
- 🎬 US credit delinquency trend approaching threshold line
